This is my high school seminar work.

Are you interested in history of Arduino? Do you just want to see my high school project? 
Well, you can...

In .pdf, you can read about history of arduino and then see, how I made DIY watch using Arduino. Just don't be suprise that the watch are bigger,
then it problably should.
